  <!--  <h1 class="mt-4" style="color:#FFFFFF">Home Page</h1> -->
  <p style="color:white"><br><br>On this page you can see the artwork I have done in a few of my GIMM classes, along with some screenshots of some games I made outside of GIMM. The reason I decided to put photos of games here, is because I want to show them, but keep the games section for games that can be played. If you would like to download some of the games shown, please go check my other site and my itch.io page. So enjoy, I hope you like what you see!</p>

  <p style="color:white;">This is a piece of concept art from my Animated Music Video from GIMM 100 and 200. Even though the final piece did turn out different then this concept, I really like this piece, and have even thought about going back and revising it into its own art piece. Unfortunately time kept gietting away from me. I hope to use some time over the coming summer to rework it.</p>

  <br><br><br><br>
  <p style="color:white;">Like the previous piece, this one was also a piece of concept art. Although unlike the last one, I had decided to try and use color to see how that would work with my animation. I didn't care for it at this particular spot, but it did make me tthink about using color near the end of my animation as a way of calling back to this concept art. Most everything in this concept was changed for the final, the tree, the camp fire, and the look of the ground.</p>

  <p style="color:white;">This is a set of screenshots from an RPG Maker game that I am hoping to put on to the itch.io market, which I have linked to on the main page. As of this being written it is still in the works, but it is going really well! I decided to build it modular, so each part is a seperate game, until I combine them all into one file If you would like to take a peek into this, I have the first part for free on my other website that I linked to.</p>

  <p style="color:white;"><br><br><br> This was a big project for me early on in GIMM, the post-apocolyptic background painting. We had to take a photo of someplace in downtown Boise and then transform it into an apocolyptic setting. It was a very difficult project for me, since I don't feel the most confident in my art skills. However in the end, I think it turned oout much better than I would've thought. This project taught me a lot on how to use photoshop in a much more effective manner.</p>
